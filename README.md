# Adaptive_Sliding_Mode_Control_of_Aerial_Manipulator
Adaptive Sliding Mode Control

This code derives the full dynamic model and control of Aerial Manipulator in Euler Lagrangian form. 

The reference for the dynamics and control law are below:

### Note 
These files calls the relevant simulink file. Go through the steps inside to realise what's happening inside the code. 

**This code was shared primarily for reference and as an educational example to support student research and learning. I would encourage users to study and understand the underlying concepts rather than copying and running the code without a solid grasp of the fundamentals.
**
For necssary dynamics and kinematics please review my paper also: 
A very similar control and dynamics can be found in my paper: Thapa S., Bai H. and Acosta J.A. Cooperative Aerial Load Transport with Force Control. IFAC Workshop on Networked & Autonomous Air & Space Systems, June, 2018
